## [Visit the app here!](https://flyio-rent-my-car-project.fly.dev/)
Rent My Car is a car sharing app where users can become hosts and rent their cars out to other users. To become a host a user has to enter information about themself and their car. The only requirement is that the user must be 21 years of age or older to rent out their car on the app. As a user, you can see a list of all of the cars being rented out by owners using the app. As a user you can view any car, and you can also go to a hosts profile and view all the cars that host owns. As a host you can add as many cars as you want to your profile, you can delete cars and update them, and you can also update the information in your bio.
